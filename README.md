### Description

(At the moment) This plugin uses the external status-script from http://status.warriorsofnargathrond.com

With "Display Lotro Server" you can configure which servers should be displayed. After configuring you can use the included Widget or the Shortcode [lotroserver] to display your list of servers.
The servers will be shown with their names and their localization (e.g. [DE] for German servers) and in brackets behind the name, a small arrow will be shown:
* a green arrow (pointing to the top) for "online"
* or a red arrow (pointing to the bottom) for "offline"

You can put the Widget in every sidebar you want, and the shortcode in every article or page.
